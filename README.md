# AngryChicken

You may need 'pic1.png' in your smartphone/iPad as a background to trigger the animation and game process.

For example, you can open the 'pic.png' in your smartphont A and keep it open, at the same time, you should install the 'AngryChickenVer1.0.apk' in your smartphone B.

Now, let B aim at A and you will find a dragon appear with animation. Drag the chicken with proper angle and strength and release your finger.

If the chicken touches the dragon, you will go to the next stage(There are 3 levels in all).
